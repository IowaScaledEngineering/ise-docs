Rule #1: Follow all rules
Rule #2: All rules are meant to be broken

--- STYLE ---
- Number ranges

	Use "X to Y" instead of "X-Y".  If abbreviated units are used,
	include the units with each number.  Example: 5V to 24V.  If spelled
	out units are used, include at the end.  Example 5 to 24 volts.

- Section dividers
	Use a horizontal line (---) between each major (H2) section

--- FORMAT ---

Start with Heading 1 formatted as:

Logo is optional, but preferred if one is available for the product

H2 Overview General overview of what this thing is and does If available. 
Keep it simple.  This text should match what is on the product page.  Link
to the store where possible.  Use short links to make future store changes
easier to fix.  Exmaple: https://www.iascaled.com/store/CKT-BD1-CMRI (i.e. 
no categories preceding the product code).

Include a photo or application image.  Keep it simple.

End with H3 sections "Features" and "Typical Applications" (if applicable). 
Match the product page.  List of features should list most important ones
first.  Optionally bold the first several to call them out.  Bold ones
should be first (i.e. important).
