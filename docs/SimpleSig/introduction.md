SimpleSig is Iowa Scaled Engineering's line of signaling products for model railroads based on the Modular Signal System (MSS) standard.  SimpleSig products are intended to be robust, easy to use, MSS-compatible components, though we do have a few accessories and stand-alone signal products that will be added to the line as well.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Modular Signal System?

The Modular Signal System (MSS) is a way to bring an approximation of a basic North American Automatic Block Signal system to a model railroad that is both easy to understand and easy to implement.  There are no computers involved whatsoever in the basic setup.  The simplest version is just a matter of installing signal and signal modules, detectors, and then linking the whole thing together with standard "crossover" type ethernet cables.

MSS was designed to be incredibly simple to set up and robust because of its roots in the FreeMo modular community  The initial standard was put forth by Gregg Fuhriman back around 2004, and it first got widespread exposure in the Feburary 2005 issue of Railmodel Journal.  What Gregg and team have developed is nothing short of brilliant in its elegant simplicity.  Being able to just plug one signaled module into the next and have them "just work" was key to success.

The standard itself is open and [available for download](http://www.modularsignalsystem.info/ModularSignalSystemStandardV2.0.2.pdf).  Because of the elegant simplicity of the system, it's easy to design your own MSS-compatible components if you're so inclined.  However, the open standard also means that there's a number of manufacturers all supporting it, and a number of other open source designs available online if you'd rather build your own.

MSS is not going to model your prototypeâ€™s strangest interlockings and aspect rules straight out of the box, though realistically with a bit of custom work you can likely get very close.  Because our SimpleSig products are all open source, they're easy to customize yourself if you have any programming experience, or we're always happy to consider customization projects for a nominal charge.

### Where Can I Learn About MSS?

I highly recommend folks take a look at the [Modular Signal System](https://modularsignalsystem.info/) website.  It's actually really good.  In particular, I recommend starting with the User Guide [Part 1](http://www.modularsignalsystem.info/MSSUserGuide1.pdf) and [Part 2](http://www.modularsignalsystem.info/MSSUserGuide2.pdf).

### What Prototype Does MSS Model?

The basic signal setup created by MSS is close to "flat pair" automatic block signaling.  It's a stand-alone system designed to provide realistic signal indications that most modelers will be familiar with, while discarding all the complexity of exactly modeling any prototype or the need for a computer or dispatcher.  ABS did not typically have multiple-headed signals at the ends of sidings (or sidings with detection, for that matter), so most MSS implementations bring it concepts from later systems such as APB and CTC to provide signal indications that a modern modeler will be more familiar with.  There's absolutely no requirement to use these, however, and more prototypical "straight ABS" systems can be achieved.

On a single track, here's an example set of signal indications as a train moves from left to right.  This example shows four indication signaling.  We know that model railroads usually have shorter runs than the prototype, so having four indications may be too many for the number of blocks between your major locations.  Our boards can be set up for either three indication (clear, approach, stop) or four indication (clear, approach, advance approach, stop) signaling as is appropriate for your layout.

There's no reason that MSS cannot be extended to more accurately represent more complicated signal regimes as well.  Some can be done within the standard as it exists today, whereas some may require some additional bits that build upon the basic standard.

## MSS Terminology

Honestly, the worst part of explaining MSS to newcomers is getting the terminology down.  It makes sense if you're either building it or really thinking about how it works electrically, but from a newcomer's standpoint, it's somewhat confusing. Once you get the general terms down it starts to make sense.

### Cascades

When you hear **cascade**, think **signal**.  All of our modules that provide cascade functionality will have "signal" in the name.

A basic cascade, such as our [Block Signal Basic](/SimpleSig/Block Signal Basic/manual) is just going to provide a pair of automatic block signals at a block boundary.

### Complex Cascades

Complex cascades build on basic cascades.  Whereas basic cascades just provide two signals at a block boundary, complex cascades model complex trackwork and route the various MSS signals to follow whatever route is selected.

The end of a siding is an excellent example of a complex cascade.  Our [Switch Signal Basic](/SimpleSig/Switch Signal Basic/manual) provides just such a module.

When the turnout is lined for the main, you want the MSS bus from the point end of the turnout connected to the MSS bus following the main track.  You also want to make sure the signal at the end of the siding is displaying stop since the turnout is set against it, and then send the appropriate signals down the siding MSS bus to indicate to display approach, advance approach, etc.

If the turnout is lined to the siding, you want the opposite behavior.  You want the MSS bus from the points connected to the MSS bus from the siding, and you want the main signal to display stop and trickle that back up the maine line MSS bus.

### Crossovers

MSS depends upon **crossovers** so that the outputs of one signal module get wired to the correct pins on the next.  Crossovers are so named because they "cross over" pins 1 & 2 as well as 3 & 6.

The simplest form of a crossover is a single "crossover" network cable.  These are different from regular network cables where rather than going straight through, and instead they swap pins 1 & 2 and pins 3 & 6.  These were used in the not-so-good old days of networking to make sure that the receive and transmit ethernet pairs were connected correctly.  They're a bit more uncommon now, but still readily available from many sources including Monoprice and Amazon.

A slightly more complex form of "crossover" is what we at ISE refer to as a [Crossover Detector](/SimpleSig/Crossover Detector/manual/).  These are devices which do cross over the signal wires, but also provide a DCC block detector.  Crossover Detectors are very important on modules in FreeMo and FreeMoN setups that do not have signals themselves, but need to have block detection to participate in MSS-enabled setups.  They are not particularly useful for home layouts where the user can install a single block detector to cover the entire block, rather than needing one for each layout module.

The **Golden Rule of MSS** is that you absolutely must have an odd number of crossovers between signal modules (cascades), but you can have as many as you want as long as it's an odd number.  Each type - simple crossover cables or Crossover Detectors - counts as a crossover in MSS-speak.  One, three, or even 253 crossovers between your cascades is perfectly fine.  Zero or 2 or any other even number?  Right out, it won't work.

### Putting It Together

The thing to remember about wiring MSS is that the wires follow the tracks.  Each cascade will chain to the next right down the line.  For situations where you have multiple tracks coming into a switch or a crossover, there will be MSS ports corresponding to each track that comes into the junction.

Here's a diagram of two basic cascades separated by three crossovers - two cables and one Crossover Detector.  This would be pretty typical of a modular setup with three modules.  The area within the dotted boxes would represent the pieces on each module.  Modules with signals are going to have a cascade board, whereas modules without signals are just going to have a crossover detector.  The modules would then be joined together with crossover cables to assure odd numbers of crossovers.

A typical home layout, on the other hand, would not use the Crossover Detectors.  It would simply connect one cascade to the next using a crossover cable.

## Block Detection

One of the very clever and unique features of MSS is the way it does block detection.  It uses a combination of current detectors and and optical detectors to work around the need to equip all your cars with resistors.  This was particularly important in a modular setup, where there's no requirement that everyone have resistor-equipped axles installed on all of their cars just for block detection.

I've borrowed the image below from the MSS User Guide - Part 1.  It shows a train passing through a block and how the combination of optical and current detectors trigger the occupancy wire without the need for resistor-equipped axles.

For home users, if you want to install resistor-equipped axles on all of your rolling stock, then you can skip installing the optical detectors and just use current detection.  Free-Mo and Free-MoN modular users will need to install both to comply with the specification and work reliably.

Even if you're not using our SimpleSig MSS components, you can still take advantage of our optical detectors from our [Trainspotter](https://www.iascaled.com/store/IRSensors) line and our [ATOM](https://www.iascaled.com/store/CKT-BD1) DCC current-based block detectors.

## Signal Terminology

### Heads vs. Masts

In North American signaling practice, we frequently talk about "heads" and "masts".  A head is a mechanism capable of displaying one aspect at a time.  A mast is a set of head - each of which can be displaying different aspects - that should be considered together to determine the name and indication of the signal.  In general, North American signals have one to three heads on any given mast.  I'm sure somebody will come up with a four or even five head prototype - because there's a prototype for everything - but these would be exceedingly uncommon.

### Aspect, Name, and Indication

Signals have three fundamental properties:  aspect, name, and indication.  These are frequently confused and often used rather loosely in conversation, but they have formal and distinct meanings.

**Aspect** is what you physically see.  For a single-headed signal, that might be green, yellow, flashing red.  For a double-headed signal, that might be red over flashing yellow.  Signals may have other attributes beyond just the lights or semaphore position, such as number or milepost plates, lettered plates with A or G or D on them, whether it's a signal on a pole or a dwarf mounted near the ground, etc.  These additional elements can change how the aspects translate to the indication.

**Name** is the formal rulebook name of a set of aspects.  Typically this will correspond to a operating rule that describes exactly what the crew is expected to do when faced with this indication.  Multiple different combinations of aspects can all fall under the same name and indication.  For example, on BNSF a single flashing yellow and a yellow-over-yellow are both "Approach Medium" and have the same indication.

**Indication** is what the aspects tell the train crew to do.  As an example, at a single-headed ABS permissive signal, red might mean come to a full stop and proceed at restricted speed if clear.  A single head displaying a green aspect almost universally means proceed at maximum authorized speed.  A single red aspect on a mast with a numberboard is usually a permissive signal, and means "stop, then proceed at restricted speed." However, that same single red aspect on a mast without a numberboard is an absolute signal, and means "stop" with no option to proceed without either dispatcher permission or a change in aspect.

While the meaning of single-headed signals is relatively uniform, combinations of aspects on multiple heads will vary from prototype to prototype.  Some railroads in some eras even had different rules for the same aspects displayed on a high signal vs. a dwarf signal.

As an example, let's take the indication of "Advance Approach," which means to proceed prepared to pass the next signal not exceeding some set speed and, if approaching a switch, be prepared to enter the diverging route not exceeding the prescribed speed for the turnout.  Western US roads typically used aspects of yellow over yellow for this, whereas eastern US roads tended to use yellow over green.  BNSF actually splits this into three different names - Approach Limited (yellow over flashing green), meaning the "set speed" above is 60 MPH; Advance Approach (yellow over green), meaning the "set speed" is 50 MPH; and Approach Medium (yellow over yellow) which sets the speed to 40 MPH.
