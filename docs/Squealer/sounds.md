Iowa Scaled Engineering has been built around the concept of open source and
the resulting community and sharing that underpins that concept.  In that
spirit, we are making the professionally recorded and edited flange squeal
clips used in the production Squealer available to customers to remix,
edit, and (hopefully) share the results with others.

These files are provided as-is and in raw form.  They are in stereo WAV
format sampled at 44.1kHz and will need to be edited and re-mixed into an
approrpate format for uploading to the SD Card on the Squealer.  See [Custom
Sounds](manual.md#custom-sounds) in the instruciton manual for more
details.

If you would like to share your creations with others, [contact us](mailto:support@iascaled.com)
and we can make them available for download.
