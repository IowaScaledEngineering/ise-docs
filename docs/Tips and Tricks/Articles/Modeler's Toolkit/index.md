# The Modeler's Electrical Toolkit

## Overview

One of the questions we get asked every now and then is about what tools we might recommend, so we decided we'd put up a series of small articles on our recommendations for various tools.

The catch is that - since we do a lot of this stuff, and we do it professionally - we tend to use some higher end gear.  For the average modeler, that's not needed.  For each category, we'll make recommendations for a budget-conscious option, a mid-range higher quality option, and then what we actually use.  We'll also make a few recommendations for how to use these things effectively.

So what things do we think should be in a basic model railroader's electronic toolkit?
