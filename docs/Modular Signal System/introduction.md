## What is the Modular Signal System?




## How is SimpleSig Different from MSS?

SimpleSig is just simply Iowa Scaled Engineering's line of signaling products for model railroads.  Most of the SimpleSig products are intended to be robust, easy to use, MSS-compatible components, though we do have a few accessories and stand-alone signal products that will be added to the line as well.

## What Prototype Does MSS Model?



There's no reason that MSS cannot be extended to more accurately represent more complicated signal regimes as well.
